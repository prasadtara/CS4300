> AI-powered Pokémon card grading for collectors and traders

---

## What is Crinkle?

Crinkle is a mobile web app that helps Pokémon card collectors estimate the grade of their cards **before** paying to submit them to professional grading services like PSA, Beckett, or CGC.

Collectors currently pay significant fees and wait weeks, sometimes months, only to receive a lower grade than expected. Crinkle eliminates that uncertainty by letting users scan a card with their phone camera and instantly receive:

- 📊 An estimated **PSA-scale grade (1–10)**
- 🔍 Detailed notes on **corners, edges, centering, and surface condition**
- 💡 Actionable insight on whether a card is worth professional grading
